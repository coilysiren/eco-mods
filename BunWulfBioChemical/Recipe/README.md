# BunWulf BioChemical

An Eco mod that gets Cutting Edge Cooking into a playable state. All of the Oil Drilling recipes have been replaced with Cutting Edge Cooking variants. These variants generally use fat, a laboratory, and are slow but low calorie cost.

You likely want to use multiple laboratories (3 ~ 4) when using this mod. Best used on a world where crops are plentiful, and iron is hard to come by.

You can find the source code for this mod here: https://github.com/coilysiren/eco-mods/tree/main/BunWulfBioChemical/Recipe

## Recipes

Note that every recipe includes a healthy amount of oil or fat. This number will be rescaled over time if it makes the recipes unprofitable (relative to Oil Drilling) on the average server.

### Plant Based Bioplastic

Uses vegetable and fat to replicate something like corn based PLA. It uses vegetable tag instead of corn to make the recipe easier to use. This recipe idea was what spawned the entire idea of this mod.

The recipe is 5 vegatable, 10 fat => 2 plastic

### Plastic Container Biofuel, 50% Ethanol

Uses 50% of the Ethanol required in the Oil Drilling recipe to make Biodiesel directly from the Cutting Edge Cooking skill. This recipe is strictly superior to the Oil Drilling recipe, due to requiring "50%" of the ethanol that Oil Drilling requires. It also takes Oil Drilling labor out of the loop for fuel creation, which is an unambiguous buff for the Cutting Edge Cooking user. The recipe also uses a plastic container, presumably a plant based plastic container, to take iron out of the equation.

The recipe is 4 ethanol, 8 plastic, 10 fat => 2 biodiesel

### Tree Rubber

A more complex recipe requiring Eco's largest tree type. This recipe uses Ceiba logs and fat to produce synthetic rubber. This is the hardest of all the cutting edge cooking recipes, and will be hard to make profitable relative to the Oil Drilling variant. The mod author will likely modify this recipe over time to make it more accessible.

The recipe is 1 ceiba log, 10 fat => 10 rubber

### Coal Fat Epoxy

One of the coal (carbon) based recipes. This recipe uses coal and fat to make a more accessible version of Oil Drilling's Epoxy. Coal and fat were chosen to approximate some kind of "sticky" substance.

The recipe is 4 coal, 10 fat => 2 epoxy

### Coal Based Nylon

One of the coal (carbon) based recipes. This recipe again uses coal and fat to create nylon. This recipe is based on the idea that nylon is a synthetic carbon based material/

The recipe is 10 coal, 10 fat => 8 nylon

### Biochar Charcoal Burning

One of the coal (carbon) based recipes. Replicates more charcoal using some base charcoal and crops inside of a bakery oven or kiln. Creates oil as a valuable by product. This recipes was primarily added as a flavorful test case, so the mod author could get used to the modding scene. It can also be used to create a lot of the fat (oil) that and charcoal required for the other recipes.

The recipe is 4 charcoal, 10 crops => 6 charcoal, 4 oil
